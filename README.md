Run the main_code.ipynb for the final project  (python) (looks like the file is too large to be viewed on github so please download and run it)

check UAV_SMC.zip for simulink version

check the pdf for report. This whole thing was done over a weekend, the project was literally decided on the last week of the course. Fun stuff tbh
